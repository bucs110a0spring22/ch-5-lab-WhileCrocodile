## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:
* Collected some functions under a Dartboard class
* Functions (methods) under the Dartboard class now uses the arguments passed to and initialized by the Dartboard class (e.g. circle radius), rather than individually hardcoded numbers
* The Dartboard class creates its own window and turtle, which is reused for its functions

Summary of function(s) added:
* The setCircle() method of the Dartboard class allows the user to set another radius for the circle.
